Pile On is an Android card game. It's basically a variation of solitaire where you play cards from your hand to one of the piles and accrue points for doing so. It's pretty straightforward - try it out!

The development process started in September 2012, but didn't begin in earnest until December 2012. As of March 2013, it's almost ready for release to the Google Play store and I hope by the time anyone reads this, it will be how they found it.

If you have any comments, bug reports, criticisms or suggestions, feel free to email me at mattbailey37@gmail.com (link on the left sidebar if you're feeling lazy). I'd love to hear any feedback and make the game better for anyone interested in playing it.

Thanks for checking it out.
